## Getting Started

For use inside Visual Studio Code:

1. Install any channel (Canary/Dev/etc.) of [Microsoft Edge](https://aka.ms/edgeinsider).
1. Install the extension* [Microsoft Edge Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-edgedevtools.vscode-edge-devtools).
1. Navigate to any project or open the folder containing the project you want to work on.

## Using the tools

### Launching the browser via the side bar view

* Start Microsoft Edge via the side bar
  * Click the `Microsoft Edge Tools` view in the side bar.
  * Click the `Open a new tab` icon to launch the browser (if it isn't open yet) and open a new tab.
* Attach the Microsoft Edge Tools via the side bar view
  * Click the `Attach` icon next to the tab to open the Microsoft Edge Tools.

The extension operates in two modes - it can launch an instance of Microsoft Edge navigated to your app, or it can attach to a running instance of Microsoft Edge. Both modes requires you to be serving your web application from local web server, which is started from either a Visual Studio Code task or from your command-line. Using the `url` parameter you tell Visual Studio Code which URL to either open or launch in the browser.

You can now use the high-fidelity tools to tweak your CSS and inspect network calls and go directly back to your code without leaving the editor.

### Opening source files from the Elements tool

One of the features of the Elements tool is that it can show you what file applied the styles and event handlers for a given node.

The source files for these applied styles and attached event handlers appear in the form of links to a url specified by the browser. Clicking on one will attempt to open that file inside the Visual Studio Code editor window.

### Setting up your project to show live changes in the extension

Out of the box the extension does not track live changes to the code you write. If you want the browser to automatically refresh when you changed a file, you need to set up a live reload environment. For this you need Node.js and npm on your machine. 

Say you have a folder with your production files on your hard drive called `my-project`. 

Preparation step: Install Node.js and the reload package

* Download and install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org) (you only need to do this once).
* Install the [reload NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reload?activeTab=readme)
  * Open command prompt and run `npm install reload -g` to install the package globally

Attach the extension to your live reloading project

* Navigate to your `my-project` folder in your command prompt and run `reload`
* Open VS Code and open the directory
* Go to the extension and launch an instance
* Navigate in the browser of the extension to `localhost:8080/{file name you want to open}`	
* All changes that are saved in this folder now trigger a refresh

## Changing Extension Settings

You can customize the extension to your needs. From version 1.1.6 onwards you can reach the Settings and read the Changelog via the `â€¦` button of the sidebar.

### Turning off Network Inspection

If you don't want to see the Network Pane to inspect any network request of the attached browser you can turn it off in the settings and restart the extension.
