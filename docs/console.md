# Getting Console information

The extension automatically forwards messages from the [Developer Tools Console](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/console/) to Visual Studio Code. You can see them in the `output` tab when you selected `Devtools Console` as the source.

Notice that this is a read-only experience. You can't use the Console like you would in the browser Developer Tools.
