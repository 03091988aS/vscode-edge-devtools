# Getting Console information

The extension automatically forwards messages from the [Developer Tools Console](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/console/) to Visual Studio Code. You can see them in the `output` tab when you selected `Devtools Console` as the source.

Notice that this is a read-only experience . We are considering a full integration with VSCode Console, but would love your feedback on how useful you would find it.
